Schedule::Cron::Events

From a line in a crontab find out when the event will actually occur,
relative to an arbitrary date.

An object oriented package which makes an object for a given crontab
line which can then be interrogated.

To install by hand on a Unix-like system:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Other systems will have their own way of doing things, but this package
basically consists of a single pure-perl library.

Depends on Set::Crontab and Time::Local
